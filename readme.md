### Youtube Music Downloader version 3 - Termux.
For Non Termux, click [here](http://github.com/datbadwolf97/YTMSDLv3).<br/>

# Wait...3rd version?

mmmmnyess...<br/>
Well, I got bored from Bash Script and decided to move into Python....<br\>

# Features?

Same as [YTMSDLv2](https://github.com/datbadwolf97/YTMSDLv2) but in Python *and colors!*<br\>
Oh also since it was in Python, it'll directly calls the functions from `yt-dlp` python package instead of command line.<br\>
Ah yes, I've cut down some useless format such as `flac`, ya know, Youtube Music already lossy so it's pointless to convert into lossless format like flac, why's there has `wav` on it?<br/>
It'll be nicer to put `wav` files into your favorite Digital Audio Workstation, right?<br/>
# Depedencies?

1. `colorama` from `pip` Package.
2. [yt-dlp](http://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) of course.
3. FFmpeg from package manager, either `apt` or `pacman` or `pamac`.
4. That's all....

## How to basic.

```
git clone http://github.com/datbadwolf97/YTMSDLv3-termux
cd YTMSDLv3-termux
```
Then run the file using :
```
python3 ydp-trm.py
```
# Question?

Q : Where the downloaded file's located at?<br/>
A : On your `~/Music` directory, right at your `Internal Storage`.<br/>

### The End.
